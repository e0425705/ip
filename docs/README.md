```
   >This implies that a file name duke.txt has been created as a storage file, with path C:\Users\PUAH\Desktop\ceg\CS2113T\IP\duke.txt, this path differs for different user and where they save the application. 
   >This file will only be created once.

```
   * The block of error message implies that there is a line of code between task example2 and example3 in the storage file duke.txt that the program cannot decode.
   * This requires the user to open duke.txt and check for the error.
   * If the issue is due to an error in the input in duke.txt, the user will have to re-enter the task into the list via `todo`, `deadline` or `event`.
   * Do note that the program will not keep the line in which there was an error in the Duke program.
      * The whole storage file duke.txt would be overwritten by the current list in the program when `save` or `bye` command is inputted.
      
   1. The "Commands available:..." provides the help list to first time users. This also can be used as reference to users who forget what are the commands available and their format. 
      * It can be printed out once again with the command `help`.
